# AGENTS.md — Assistant Operating Rules

**Priority:** correctness > safety > minimal diffs > speed

---

## Non-Negotiable Rules (HARD)

1. **NEVER** claim verification passed without raw output
2. **NEVER** skip expert load in Full mode
3. **NEVER** edit files in Full mode without MS-#### assigned first
4. **NEVER** leave work incomplete without stating exactly what remains
5. **ALWAYS** declare MODE before first edit (see Mode Declaration below)

---

## Mode Declaration (BLOCKING)

**Before ANY file edit, output this block:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ MODE: [Lite | Full]                 │
│ ID: [MS-#### | N/A]                 │
│ REASON: [one sentence]              │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**IF this block is not present before your first edit → VIOLATION.**

---

## Usage Modes (Critical) (Hard)

- **IDE Chat:** `prompts/` + `system/tracking/` — no `.marge/`
- **CLI:** `marge` commands — `.marge/` optional

---

## Scope (Critical) (Hard)

This folder is tooling, not the target. Work happens OUTSIDE this folder.
- **Track findings** → `./system/tracking/`
- **Never** create files from this folder elsewhere
- **Always** invoke expert subagents for analysis

---

## Task Modes (Critical) (Hard)

| Trigger | Mode | Behavior |
|---------|------|----------|
| Single-line typo, comment, format (no behavior change) | **Lite** | MODE block → Fix → List files. No MS-####. |
| Feature, refactor, audit, multi-file, behavior change | **Full** | MODE block → MS-#### → Experts → Workflow |

**Lite Mode Boundary:**
- IF files_modified > 1 → Switch to Full
- IF lines_changed > 10 → Switch to Full  
- IF behavior changes → Switch to Full
- IF tests affected → Switch to Full

**When in doubt → Full mode.** Over-tracking is better than lost context.

**"Behavior change" means ANY of:**
- Function signature changes (params, return type)
- Different return values for same inputs
- Exception/error handling changes
- State mutation changes
- API contract changes
- Side effects added/removed

**"One concept" means:**
- Changes sharing the SAME root cause, OR
- Changes required for ONE user-facing outcome
- Example: "Fix login bug" = 1 concept (even if 3 files)
- Example: "Fix login + add logout" = 2 concepts = 2 IDs

**3-File Checkpoint:**
After modifying 3 files under one MS-####:
1. STOP
2. List files changed and reasons
3. Confirm all serve SAME conceptual goal
4. IF divergent → create new MS-####

EXCEPTION: Mechanical changes (rename, format, import) across 3+ files may continue under one ID if ALL changes are identical in nature.

---

## Core Rules (Critical) (Hard)

1. **Verify before acting** — Read files, search codebase. Never assume.
2. **Root cause only** — No band-aids or workarounds
3. **Minimal surface** — Fewest files, fewest lines
4. **Document reasoning** — Capture *why*, not just *what*
5. **No hardcoded secrets** — Environment variables only
6. **State uncertainty** — Declare: checked, known, unknown

**Stop for approval when:** 3+ files, architectural change, or public API modification. Include plan + risks.

**"Architectural" means ANY of:**
- Adding/removing external dependency
- Changing data flow between modules  
- Modifying public API signatures
- Changing persistence/storage patterns
- Adding required environment variables

---

## Violation Recovery (HARD)
When ANY rule is violated:
1. STOP — Halt current task
2. DECLARE — `⚠️ VIOLATION: [rule] at [action]`
3. RECOVER — Based on type:
   | Violation | Recovery |
   |-----------|----------|
   | Missing MODE block | Declare MODE, continue |
   | Missing MS-#### | Assign ID, continue |
   | Missing expert citation | Load expert now, cite it |
   | Skipped verification | Run verify before proceeding |
4. LOG — Note violation in assessment.md

---

## Special States (HARD)

| State | Trigger | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| **BLOCKED** | Need info to proceed | List blockers → Request input → WAIT (no partial work) |
| **ABORT** | User cancels mid-task | Update tracking with partial state → List remaining work → END |
| **LOOP_EXHAUSTED** | 5 passes without resolution | Dump state: attempts, blockers, current status → Request guidance |

---

## Expert Subagents (Critical) (Hard)

**Full mode requires experts. No exceptions.**

| Task | Experts | Reference |
|------|---------|-----------|
| Security/audit | 2-3 security | `security.md` |
| Architecture | Systems + Implementation | `architecture.md` |
| Code changes | Implementation + Testing | `implementation.md`, `testing.md` |
| Frontend/UI | Design + Implementation | `design.md` |
| Deployment | DevOps + Documentation | `devops.md` |
| Research | 2+ domain experts | `./system/experts/_index.md` |

> **📋 Full list:** See [`./system/experts/_index.md`](./system/experts/_index.md) for all available experts and their capabilities.

**Rules:**
- Parallel subagents when tasks are independent
- Direct tools (no expert) only for: reading, running commands, single-line Lite fixes
- Uncertain? More experts, not fewer.

### Expert Citation
When loading experts, list them:
```
📚 Experts loaded: [filename1.md], [filename2.md]
   Applied to: [current task]
```

---

## Tracking (Critical) (Hard)

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `./system/tracking/assessment.md` | Findings + evidence |
| `./system/tracking/tasklist.md` | Work queue |
| `./system/tracking/feature_plan_template.md` | Template for feature plans |

**When to use what:**
- Simple bug/fix/task: `assessment.md` + `tasklist.md` only
- New feature (multi-step): Copy `feature_plan_template.md` → `[feature]_PLAN.md` + tracking files
**Workflow:** IMPLEMENT → VERIFY → RECORD → COMPLETE

**Verify command:**
- Windows: `./system/scripts/verify.ps1 fast`
- Unix: `./system/scripts/verify.sh fast`

**Rule:** Never claim "passed" without pasting raw output. If verify fails, fix before proceeding.

---

## Routing (Critical) (Hard)

| Intent | Signal | Action |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **Ask** | Question, "how", "why" | Answer directly. No workflow. |
| **Do** | Fix, build, add, change, refactor | Load `work.md`. Assign MS-####. |
| **Audit** | "audit", "review", "scan" | Load `audit.md` → creates work items. |
| **Plan** | "PLANNING ONLY", "brainstorm" | Load `planning.md`. No code. |

**Lifecycle** (automatic): `session_start.md`, `session_end.md`, `loop.md`

**Mixed intent:** Answer questions inline, then process each work item (separate MS-####).

---

## Response Format (Critical) (Hard)

Every Full-mode response ends with:
- IDs touched (MS-####)
- Files modified (count: X)
- Verification output (raw)

Compliance indicator:
```
✅ MODE declared | ✅ ID assigned | ✅ Experts loaded | ✅ Verified
```
(Mark ❌ for any missing step)

Full template: `./system/workflows/work.md`

---

## Resources (Critical) (Hard)

- **Decisions:** `./system/knowledge/_index.md`
- **Experts:** `./system/experts/_index.md`
- **Workflows:** `./system/workflows/_index.md`

---

## Mindset (Critical)

**Craftsman, not generator.** Every change must be:
- **Elegant** — simplest solution that fully solves it
- **Inevitable** — so right it feels like the only way
- **Better** — leave codebase improved, never degraded

| Folder | Contains |
|--------|----------|
| `system/` | workflows, experts, tracking, scripts |
| `prompts/` | user-facing prompt templates |
| `cli/` | command-line tools |

**When stuck:** Re-read AGENTS.md → Check `decisions.md` → Load expert → Ask.
