# OLD_AGENTS.md — Historical Reference

> **⚠️ This file is deprecated.** See [../AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) for the current version.

This file is kept for historical reference and backward compatibility with the global install system.

## Historical Note

This backup was created during the folder restructure (MS-0001) to preserve compatibility with:
- `cli/install-global.sh` - Copies this to `$MARGE_HOME/shared/bak/`
- `scripts/test-marge-cli.sh` - Validates this file exists in global install

The current AGENTS.md lives at the repo root and is the source of truth.
